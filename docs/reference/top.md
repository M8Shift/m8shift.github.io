# `m8shift-top` dashboard reference

`m8shift-top.py` is M8Shift's read-only terminal dashboard. It turns the core
`status --json` snapshot into a live overview without claiming the pen, changing
relay state, or routing work. From an initialized project root, run:

```bash
python3 m8shift-top.py
```

The dashboard refreshes every two seconds by default. Use `--interval SECONDS`
to change that cadence and `--utc` to render every timestamp in UTC with a `Z`
suffix.

## Frame and header

The box-drawing frame separates one refresh from ordinary terminal output. In an
interactive terminal it occupies the alternate screen, uses the real terminal
width and height, and restores the previous screen when it exits.

The header identifies the data being viewed:

- **M8SHIFT** is the dashboard wordmark.
- **Project** is the initialized project name, so an operator can distinguish
  terminals before acting elsewhere.
- **Version** is the `m8shift.py` engine version that produced the snapshot, not
  a dashboard-only release number.
- **Session** is the immutable identifier of the current relay session.
- **Clock** is the render time. It uses the local timezone by default and UTC
  when invoked with `--utc`.

The frame is structural, not decorative: after ANSI colour codes are removed,
every line remains exactly the selected terminal width.

## PEN and TTL

The two rows share fixed columns, so their related values line up at narrow and
wide sizes.

### PEN

The PEN row describes relay ownership:

- **Agent** is the current holder or awaited agent.
- **State badge** is the literal relay state, such as `[WORKING_AGENT-A]`.
  Brackets and text preserve the meaning without colour.
- **Turn** is the holder's live or next turn while the relay is working or
  awaiting. In states with no live turn, the dashboard labels the last turn
  instead; it never attributes a completed turn to a new holder.
- **Claimed** is when the current state window began.
- **Heartbeat** is the matching holder heartbeat expressed as an age such as
  `12 s ago`, growing through minutes and hours. A missing heartbeat is `—`.
  Green means fresh, yellow means alive past the lease boundary, and red means
  ordinarily stale. The age remains the primary evidence; colour only reinforces
  it.

### TTL

The TTL row describes the 30-minute pen lease:

- **Gauge** is the remaining share of the lease. Filled and empty cells make the
  trend visible in monochrome.
- **Time left** is the remaining lease as `MM:SS`, clamped to zero after expiry.
- **Expires** is the lease deadline in the selected display timezone.
- **Alive / stale** is the deadline comparison shown as text and colour. Green
  `alive` means time remains; red `stale` means the deadline has passed.

TTL expiry and heartbeat liveness are related but not interchangeable. An
`alive-expired` holder can have an expired lease and a fresh protective
heartbeat; operators must follow the core stale-recovery rules rather than infer
takeover permission from the gauge alone.

## AGENTS

There is one AGENTS row per relay member:

- `✦` marks the current pen holder.
- The agent identifier is followed by an optional self-declared model. A trailing
  `*` means the model label is unverified; the note below the rows repeats that
  boundary.
- The dot and adjacent word show the role state. Green `idle`, yellow `working`,
  and a dim unknown state remain readable as words without colour.
- **5h** and **weekly** are provider usage windows. A percentage below 60% is
  green, 60% to below 85% is yellow, and 85% or more is red. If the provider
  supplies a reset instant, it appears beside the percentage. `n/a` means the
  provider structurally did not supply that window; `unavailable` means the
  reading could not be obtained. `EXHAUSTED [model]` is explicit when a window
  reaches 100% and a model is known.

Usage is advisory. It does not change claimability, relay state, or the pen.

## LISTEN

LISTEN summarizes roster-owned listener sidecars:

- `agent-a ALIVE` means the compact status snapshot found that resident
  listener's PID alive.
- `none` means no live listener was found.
- `unavailable` means the snapshot value itself could not be read.

Do not read **wake-ready** as **ALIVE**. A foreground waiter can be wake-ready in
the limited sense that it detected the next turn, but it cannot invoke a new
agent run. The compact dashboard currently promotes only live listener PIDs;
confirm the invocation backend with
`python3 m8shift-runtime.py listener status --agent AGENT` before describing a
setup as autonomous.

## LEDGER and TURN

LEDGER projects four bounded operational counts:

- **tasks _N_ open** counts open entries in the task event log;
- **decisions _N_ pending** counts decision records whose status is proposed,
  pending, or draft;
- **doctor _N_ findings** reports the local kit diagnostic count; zero is green
  and one or more is red;
- **gate armed / disarmed** says whether a valid usage-budget configuration is
  present. Armed is green and disarmed is yellow. The gate is advisory and does
  not replace the core pen rules.

Unknown values are rendered as `unavailable` instead of being guessed. Task and
decision counts use cyan as information, not as a good/bad verdict.

TURN summarizes the most recently completed turn: immutable turn number, author,
optional self-declared model, recipient, and a bounded excerpt of its ask. In
the wide layout the label is `TURN`; the stacked layout spells it `LAST TURN`.

## ACTIVITY and the expanded reader

ACTIVITY is a newest-first, bounded view of recent completed turns. Its heading
uses real immutable turn numbers, for example `turns 39-42 / 42`, rather than
buffer indices.

The compact wide table shows turn, timestamp, approximate hold duration, agent,
self-declared model, action, and note. The stacked layout keeps the essential
turn, agent/model, and summary. At most 20 events are visible. The dashboard asks
core status for the viewport plus bounded scroll headroom, capped at 200 events;
it does not reread the archive on every refresh. At the oldest edge of a
truncated buffer, `<older turns on disk — peek/journal>` says explicitly that
deeper history remains elsewhere.

Press `e` on a compact row to open the expanded reader. It fetches exactly that
immutable turn with the read-only `turn NUMBER --json` surface, sanitizes terminal
control characters, and word-wraps the complete `done` text without truncating
it. Automatic refreshes reuse the fetched record. Up/down selects the
newer/older turn block; left/right pages through text that is taller than the
activity zone. Press `e` again to return to compact mode.

## TIME

The permanent TIME strip accounts for the whole current session rather than one
activity row:

- **effective\*** is time in `WORKING_*`. The asterisk matters: this is an
  exclusive WORKING-state proxy, not a measurement of productivity, CPU use, or
  result quality.
- **non-work** is time in `AWAITING_*`, `PAUSED`, and `IDLE`. When space allows,
  the strip shows those three components.
- **unknown** is unclassified wall time whose transition evidence is missing,
  malformed, unsupported, or ambiguous. It is always retained when accounting
  is partial.

The accounting invariant is `wall = effective + non-work + unknown`. Coverage
is `(wall - unknown) / wall`. An exact record has 100% coverage and omits
`unknown`; a partial record keeps `unknown` visible, and its classified totals
cover only the evidenced intervals. The detailed quality, coverage percentage,
and diagnostics remain available through `m8shift.py status` and
`m8shift.py time` even when terminal width forces the top strip to abbreviate.

TIME colours are deliberately non-judgmental: effective and non-work are
informational cyan, while unknown is yellow because it marks incomplete
evidence rather than a relay failure.

## Keyboard reference

| Key | Compact dashboard | Expanded activity |
|---|---|---|
| `q` | Quit and restore the terminal | Same |
| `?` | Open or close the full-screen help | Same |
| `r` | Reload the snapshot now | Reload the snapshot now |
| `Esc` | Close help and reload | Close help and reload |
| `e` | Expand the selected activity turn | Return to compact activity |
| `↑` / `↓` | Scroll recent activity | Select the newer / older turn block |
| `←` / `→` | No action | Page backward / forward through complete text |

The footer also displays the automatic refresh interval. Keys are read in
cbreak mode, so Enter is not required.

## Colour semantics

Colour is redundant: every state also has a word, number, badge, marker, or
gauge.

| Colour | Meaning in the dashboard |
|---|---|
| Yellow / amber | Pen holder, TTL gauge, elevated usage, incomplete evidence, or a disarmed advisory gate |
| Green | Healthy, idle, live, fresh, zero findings, or an armed gate |
| Red | Stale, near a provider limit, or one-or-more doctor findings |
| Cyan | Version and neutral informational values |
| Magenta | Live/next-turn relay arrow |
| Dim | Structure, unavailable data, and secondary notes |
| Inverse light badge | Literal relay state |

The renderer selects truecolour when `COLORTERM` is `truecolor` or `24bit`,
xterm-256 when `TERM` contains `256color`, semantic ANSI-16 otherwise, and plain
text when `NO_COLOR` is present or `TERM=dumb`. `NO_COLOR` changes presentation,
not content or alignment.

## Degradation matrix

| Environment or missing capability | Dashboard behaviour | Information retained |
|---|---|---|
| Interactive POSIX TTY, 100+ columns | Wide, tabulated alternate-screen view | Full sections and aligned semantic tracks |
| Interactive POSIX TTY, 24-99 columns | Stacked view; width is never treated as less than 24 | PEN, TTL, agents, listeners, ledger, turn, bounded activity, TIME, keys |
| Short terminal | ACTIVITY shrinks first, down to zero rows | Safety and ownership sections remain; terminal cropping is preferred to silently dropping them |
| Very tall terminal | ACTIVITY shows at most 20 events and blank-fills the remaining frame | Readability, exact frame height, and footer position |
| Terminal resize | A POSIX resize wakeup recomputes both dimensions and clamps the saved activity offset | Current help/mode and valid scroll position |
| `NO_COLOR` or `TERM=dumb` | No ANSI colour escapes | All labels, badges, percentages, symbols, and frame geometry |
| Non-TTY, piped output, `--plain`, `M8SHIFT_NO_ALT_SCREEN`, or native Windows | Falls back to the core scrolling `watch` view | Read-only status monitoring without alternate-screen or cbreak assumptions |
| Provider omits a usage window | Shows `n/a` | Distinction between absent data and a failed read |
| Snapshot field cannot be read | Shows `unavailable` or `—` | Honest uncertainty; no invented value |
| More recent activity exists than the bounded buffer can hold | Shows the older-history edge marker | Real turn positions and an explicit route to deeper history |
| Partial time evidence | Keeps `unknown` visible | Honest lower-bound classified totals and recoverable coverage detail |

## Read-only and compatibility boundaries

The dashboard consumes snapshot schema major version 1 and refuses an
unsupported major instead of guessing. Normal refresh uses the bounded status
snapshot; expanded activity performs a point read only after an explicit `e`
selection. Neither path claims, releases, refreshes, or writes the relay pen.
